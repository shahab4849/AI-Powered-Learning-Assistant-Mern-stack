# AI-Powered Learning Assistant Mern stack
we'll build a Full-Stack AI Learning Assistant App using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, styled with Tailwind CSS, and powered by Google Gemini AI. This app transforms PDFs into interactive study experiences with AI chat, auto-generated flashcards, quizzes, summaries, and progress tracking — all in one place.
